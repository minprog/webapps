# Final version

Make sure that you have a *working* product to submit. This means that every button should work, navigation should be logical, no TODOs in place; i.e., there are no loose ends visible to the user. You might need to remove certain parts of your code to clean it up!

## Updating the README

Your GitHub repository should contain a complete `README.md` file that states the application name, one or two screen shots (**resized** to small width/height), a description of the app's purpose, and your name. The `README` should be easy to read and give a quick overview.

## Updating your design document

The `DESIGN.md` should still be in the root of your repository, next to the `README.md`. You should update it to provide a high-level technical overview of your app as it is now. Things we'll look for:

- To understand a web app, it's nice to start at the routes/URLs. However, there may be many and the purpose may not immediately be clear. In your `DESIGN`, provide tiny screenshots of the main functions (screens/interactions) of the app, and for each:

    - describe which file implements that functionality (if needed),
    - provide a list of which routes/URLs are connected to what functionality,
    - describing the task that each route performs.

- List other parts that should be looked at.

In general, do not present all info in one big list, but instead try to present the information clearly for someone who doesn't quite know your project.

## Adding ASSESSMENT.md

Take a look at the [syllabus](/syllabus) to see how your project will be assessed. In `ASSESSMENT.md` you should make a simple list of thing that you do not want us to miss when grading! Clearly point us to things in your code that you particularly like, or describe how you cleaned up certain parts, or parts of the functionality of the app that you're particularly proud of. You should expect that we take all of your code and functionality into account for grading, not just what you list here, but we surely do not want to miss those best parts!

Also, choose the biggest decisions you've taken during the project, from your `PROCESS.md` and write about those: why did you make the decision, what was bad about the previous design ideas, why is the new solution better (and is it still better, now that your project is finished?). A small paragraph, like this one, per big decision suffices.

## Choosing a license for your work

A copyright statement can be either:

- a *public domain* release, which releases your code to the public without any restrictions (you could also use the *unlicense* for this, see below)

- a *copyright notice* which states who actually owns the rights to the materials in the repository (probably only you)

Copyright is automatic in the Netherlands: if you create something, you own the copyright, but you can release your code to the public domain by stating so in (for example) the `README` file.

If you do want to retain copyright, which is common, then you should note the copyright including the current year, followed by "Alle rechten voorbehouden" or "All rights reserved". This clause means that you will not allow copying, modification, distribution etc.

Even if you claim "All rights reserved," you can add a more liberal license to that, allowing some ways of sharing or modification. This is common for open source projects. If you're proud of your code and want other people to share, you might add an open source license. Anyone who finds your project on GitHub can see that you're fine with sharing!

Follow directions at [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/) to add a `LICENSE` file and choose a license that you like, unless you retain all rights for yourself.

## Adding acknowledgements

The `README` should also acknowledge sources of external code, images and other materials that are in the repository but not created by yourself. Make sure that it is clear which directories are copyrighted by different creators.

You do not have to credit authors of small code snippets (for example, from Stack Overflow) in your `README`. Instead, you should have added a small comment near the snippet, right in your code. You do not have to credit the teachers, who are happy to have helped you, but do not claim copyright for their contributions :-)

## Submitting

Submit your final code by *push*ing it to GitHub and creating a pull request. Make sure you are not missing anything! Some files that you should probably have:

- the **README.md**
- the **PROCESS.md** that you updated during the project
- the **ASSESSMENT.md** listing the best parts of your project
- a **docs** folder for the images in your documents
- a separate folder containing your project's code
- the license in *LICENSE*
- any configuration files like **.gitignore**

*Note the rules for late submissions on the homepage!*
