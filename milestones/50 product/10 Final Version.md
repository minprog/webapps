# Final version

Make sure that you have a *working* product to submit. This means that every button should work, navigation should be logical, no TODOs in place; i.e., there are no loose ends visible to the user. You might need to remove certain parts of your code to clean it up!

> Na vandaag mag je NIETS meer veranderen aan de code van je project. Het moet werken, goed online staan en de code moet netjes zijn. De code vormt de basis voor de beoordeling van de aspecten "Code" en "Interactieontwerp" van je eindcijfer.


## Updating the README

Your GitHub repository should contain a complete `README.md` file that states the application name, one or two screen shots (**resized** to small width/height), a description of the app's purpose, and your name. The `README` should be easy to read and give a quick overview.


## Submitting

Submit your final code by *push*ing it to GitHub and creating a pull request. Make sure you are not missing anything! Some files that you should probably have:

- the **README.md**
- the **PROCESS.md** that you updated during the project
- the **ASSESSMENT.md** listing the best parts of your project
- a **docs** folder for the images in your documents
- a separate folder containing your project's code
- the license in *LICENSE*
- any configuration files like **.gitignore**

*Note the rules for late submissions on the homepage!*
