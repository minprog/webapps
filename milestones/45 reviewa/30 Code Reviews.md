## Code review

You'll team up with another student and perform a code review on each other's repository. Make sure your repository is cleaned up and ready for review before Tuesday at 12 (noon), and then do the code reviews.

1. Pick a partner.

2. Open your project on your computer and put your partner in front of it. Your partner should navigate the code, not you!

3. Your partner will now comment (aloud!) on your code. You will listen. If there are questions, answer them. Make note of those questions: this may be where your project could be better documented, or where your code could be more clear!

The reviewer must pay attention to:

- How easy it is to make sense of the complete code base (can you understand what goes where and why?). Think aloud when doing this, so the coder under review can take notes and make their code better.

- Stylistic issues in the code. Make sure that you point out the weak spots. These need to be fixed, especially before the final release (but also before the next code review!).

Doing this will help you and your partner learn, and obtain higher grades, depending on how well you perform the review!

Note: your will not actually *run* the code during the code review! That is not what code review is about.
