# Final version

This week, you'll work towards submitting the final code of your project.

> Make sure that you have a *working* product to submit. If it does not work, it cannot be considered for grading. This means that every button should work; i.e., there are no loose ends visible to the user.

## Changing the `README.md` and choosing a license for your work

https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/


Your GitHub repository should contain a complete **README.md** file that states the application name, a couple of screen shots (resized to appropriate width/height for readability), its purpose, your name and a copyright statement. The README should be easy to read.

The copyright statement can be either:

- a *public domain* release, which releases your code to the public without any restrictions (you could also use the *unlicense* for this)

- a *copyright notice* which states who actually owns the rights to the materials in the repository (probably only you)

Make sure that you have the correct license in your **LICENSE** file.

The **README.md** should also acknowledge sources of external code, images and other materials that are in the repository but not created by yourself. Make sure that it is clear which directories are copyrighted by different creators.

Also note that these materials have their own respective licenses. You should at the very least note this fact (again, in the **README.md**). Make sure you also check the licenses to see if you should make a special statement about the source of the materials.

## Submitting

Submit your final code by *push*ing it to GitHub. Make sure you are not missing anything!

- the **README.md**
- the license in *LICENSE*
- the old **PROPOSAL.md** (unchanged from week 1)
- the old **DESIGN.md** (unchanged from week 1)
- the old **PROCESS.md**
- **STYLE.md** from your group assignment
- a new **REPORT.md**
- a **docs** folder for the images in your documents
- a separate folder containing your project's code
- any configuration files like **.gitignore**

*Note the rules for late submissions on the homepage!*
