# Process book

As soon as you finish your design and start coding, you need to create a process book in which you keep track of your progress during the project. Note that it is not necessary to describe in detail what you have been working on every day. You do need to describe your **most important findings and challenges** during the project. At the end of the project this process book gives an insight in the progression of the project from beginning to end, and it will help you write your report.

In your process book, you chronicle your big decisions. When faced with a decision during the day, document it like this:

* The choice you've made
* What you expect to happen as a result of that choice (at this moment in time)
* Why you expect things to pan out that way

By doing so, you can use your process book for reflection. By documenting and periodically reviewing your decisions, you'll get a better grasp on the overall project and you might be able to identify trends or common traps you find yourself falling into.

To put it simply, a process book helps to refine your decision-making process as you move forward, rather than being something that helps you actually make a choice in the moment.

Start your process book now by creating a file called `PROCESS.md` in the root folder of your repository. **Make sure to update it every day and push it to GitHub!**
