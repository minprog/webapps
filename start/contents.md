# Getting Started

## GitHub

First, create a GitHub account. On GitHub, developers from all over the world share code and work together. And indeed, for this course, we use GitHub to host your projects, and you'll use GitHub to login to Ed (see the next step).

## Ed

Then you can register on Ed. This is an online forum for Q&A (questions and answers) about this course. There, you'll find others who are taking the course and might just be able to help you with your questions.
