# Web App Studio

## About this course

"This course picks up where Harvard College's CS50 leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Flask, Django, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, students learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku. By semester's end, students emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower them to design and deploy applications on the Internet." --- CSCI S-33a at Harvard.

This course is offered by the [Programming Lab](https://www.mprog.nl/) team at the University of Amsterdam. It is quite self-contained, but you might need some help here and there in case you can stuck. Ask your fellow students!

If you'd like to adopt this course for your students and need a bit of help, feel free to contact [Martijn Stegeman](mailto:help@mprog.nl) at the University of Amsterdam.

## Getting Started

This course has four programming projects, from a first personal homepage to a fully featured food ordering website. Each project has a few video lectures that you should use to prepare. We expect that you complete all assignments using techniques and examples from those lectures!

Before you create your first project, please head to the ["Getting Started"](/start) section to create a few accounts and configure your system for web development.

Have fun!
