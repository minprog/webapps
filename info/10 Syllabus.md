# Web App Studio

{:toc}

*Syllabus, Winter 2019*

<!-- Today's applications are increasingly mobile. Computers are no longer confined
to desks and laps but instead live in our pockets and hands. This course
teaches students how to build mobile apps for Android and iOS, two of today's
most popular platforms, and optionally, how to deploy them on Google Play and
the App Store. Students practice using the platforms through a series of
programming assignments, and working towards a final project to show off
everything that has been learned. Students learn to write native apps for
Android using Studio and the Android SDK *or* to write native apps for iPhones,
iPod Touches, and iPads using Xcode and the iOS SDK. -->


## Expectations

You are expected to complete the provided exercises, attend most office hours, submit four fully working websites, improve on those apps for your portfolio, and to confer with your mentor regularly. You are also expected to work on preparations for your final programming project.


## Getting started 

- Check if your [personal timetable](https://datanose.nl/) shows Web App Studio.
- Read the remainder of this syllabus.
<!-- - Install all required software for [Android](/installation/android). -->
- Come to the first session to get acquainted to the staff.
- When in doubt, contact the course's heads at <help@mprog.nl> or speak to your mentor.


## Prerequisites 

Programming 1 and 2, or equivalent, as decided by the course's instructor. You need to be
comfortable with memory management, runtime analysis, design patterns, databases, and basic data
structures and algorithms. You also need to have a laptop capable of running Python.


## Asking questions

The course's staff consists of your instructor and many teaching assistants. You are encouraged to ask questions to the staff. Whenever you are in the lab, feel free to send a help request by using the <i class="fa fa-hand-pointer-o fa-fw"></i> menu, above.

A list of the course's staff:

- Martijn Stegeman (instructor)
- Renske Talsma (Android)
- Natasja Wezel (Android)


## What to do

Every week, lectures and a project will be made available. 
Final grades are determined using the following weights:

TODO: project 0,1,2,3 moeten 5.5 zijn?

| projects (0,1,2,3) | 50% |
| final project      | 50% |


| number | weight |
| -----: | -----: |
| 0      | 0%     |
| 1      | 33%    |
| 2      | 33%    |
| 3      | 33%    |


For both exercises and projects, there are seven deadlines. There is also one final deadline for submitting improved versions of your projects for your portfolio.

| number |    deadline |  
| ------ | ----------: |  
| 0      | ?           |
| 1      | Thu   4-Apr |  
| 2      | Thu  11-Apr |  
| 3      | Thu  18-Apr |  
| final  | Mon  27-May |  

You must complete all projects before the deadline to be eligible for a satisfactory grade, unless granted an exception in writing by the course's heads. Also, no retakes are possible for any part of the course. You may re-take the course as a whole in a later semester.


### Grades 

Each week, you will create a website using the concepts introduced in lectures. 
<!-- Grading takes place portfolio-style. At the end of the course, you will created have seven projects and refined those during the weeks after first submitting. -->

To get credit for each project, demonstrate its functionality on or before that websites's deadline. You will receive immediate feedback from the staff and the website's completion will be noted.

Final grading will take place afer the deadline of the website using the following scheme:

| pts | description                                                                          |  
| --: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |  
|   5 | Exceptional quality in use, layout and code. Probably something extra or unexpected. |  
|   4 | Solid quality in use, layout and code. Maybe some trivial errors or oversight.       |  
|   3 | Reasonable quality, but lots of room for improvement.                                |  
|   2 | The app mostly works but really lacks in quality.                                    |  
|   1 | Clearly, quite a bit of effort went into it, but it does not really work.            |  
|   0 | Not submitted or very incomplete.                                                    |  

## Code reviews

You'll review your peers' apps and have peers review your own creations. This is an excellent opportunity to get feedback on your portfolio.


## Office hours

Office hours are opportunities to work on projects and exercise materials alongside the course's teaching assistants.

| weekday  | Android |  
| -------- | ------: |  
| Mondays  |  11--13 |  
| Thursday |  11--13 |  


## Mentoring

You are expected to make an appointment with your assigned mentor on Fridays every week. Your mentor will help you get started, provide you with additional feedback for your portfolio and can answer most practical questions.


## Tutoring 

For students who avail themselves of the course's other resources but still find themselves struggling, the course offers tutoring, to the extent possible, providing opportunities for students to work with the course's staff one-on-one or in particularly small groups. To arrange, contact the course's heads.


## Books 

No books are required, but the following book may provide additional learning material: Bill Phillips, Chris Stewart and Kristin Marsicano, [*Android Programming, the Big Nerd Ranch Guide*](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming/).
William S. Vincent, [Django for Beginners](https://djangoforbeginners.com/).

## Collaboration

All work that you do toward fulfillment of this course's expectations must be
your own work. You may read and comment upon classmates' code toward
fulfillment of projects' code reviews but only *after* the deadline for that project has passed and you have signed off your submission. You may integrate ideas and
techniques that you glean from your reviews of classmates' code and from
classmates' reviews of your code into your own work, so long as you attribute
those ideas and techniques back to your classmates, as with comments in your
own code. You may discuss projects, including designs, but you may not share
*code*. In other words, you may communicate with those classmates in English,
but you may not communicate in Swift, Java, or Objective-C and such languages.
If in doubt as to the appropriateness of some discussion, contact the course's
heads.


### Quoting sources 

You may turn to the web for instruction beyond the course's lectures and
sections, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not
for outright solutions to problems on homework or your project. However,
failure to cite (as with comments) the origin of any code or technique that you
do discover outside of the course's lectures and sections (even while
respecting these constraints) and then integrate into your own work may be
considered academic dishonesty.


### Regulations

All forms of academic dishonesty are dealt with harshly. In all cases we follow the directives
regarding fraud and plagiarism of the University of Amsterdam and of the Computer Science BSc
programme. Find them here in [English] and [Dutch].
