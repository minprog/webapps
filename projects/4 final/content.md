# Project requirements

> Please note: maak een afspraak met de **[projectbegeleiding](http://calendly.com/app-studio/assistentie-parttime)** na elke afronding van een milestone! Zeker de eerste milestones zijn cruciale momenten voor feedback en moeten afgetekend worden. Er is in principe dagelijks plek voor deze afspraken.

Here we list the **requirements** that all submitted projects should accommodate.

- *Functional requirements* define the scope of the project
- *Implementation details* make sure all projects can be graded in the same way and ensure usefulness to a broad audience
- *Process requirements* help us track your progress and help you to get a good grade

A **general requirement** is that your web app may not be based on code you wrote earlier or be similar to the projects you did in this or other courses (it must be a new project) and that you cannot do a project for which the requirements will be set by a third party (the project must be done for this course and not for anyone else).

## Functional requirements<br><small>What it should do</small>

- Your product should provide a solution for a clearly defined human problem and a clearly defined target audience.

- Alternatively, your product may tell an interactive story or allow users to play a game.

- Your product should be reasonably original with regards to apps that are available on the web these days.

- Your product should embody good interaction design practices, to help users easily navigate your site and accomplish their goals.

- Your product's design should fit well in the platform you're using for layout, like Bootstrap.

> Note: originality in this case doesn't mean that you must create a totally new idea that has never existed! Originality should likely come from restricting your idea to a specific target audience, to a specific data set, or in some other way. Actually, putting in restrictions can help you make your project fit in a few weeks and at the same time allow you to make it much better and more polished!

## Implementation details<br><small>How it must be implemented</small>

- Your web application must utilize Flask, JavaScript, and SQL.

- Your web application must be sufficiently complex, as determined by the course's instructor.

- Your web application's source code must include your name in a comment atop every source file in the project to indicate that you wrote it (unless re-using a source file from another project).

- Your web application must be reproducible on another computer by cloning the repository and following instructions in the `README`.

- jQuery may not be used except to use standard functionality from web frameworks like Bootstrap. If you don't know what jQuery is, that's fine!

## Process requirements<br><small>What else you need to do</small>

- You must keep track of your code via git and push your code to GitHub at the end of each day.

- You must keep a process book, as explained later.

- Your web application must be shown running on the final day of the course.
