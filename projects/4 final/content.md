# Project requirements

Here we list the requirements that all submitted projects should accommodate. *Functional requirements* define the scope of the projects, and *implementation details* make sure all projects can be graded in the same way, while ensuring usefulness to a broad audience.

A **general requirement** is that your web app may not be based on code you wrote earlier or be similar to the projects you did in this or other courses (it must be a new project) and that you cannot do a project for which the requirements will be set by a third party (the project must be done for this course and not for anyone else).

## Functional requirements<small>What it should do</small>

- Your product should provide a solution for a clearly defined human problem and a clearly defined target audience.

- Alternatively, your product may tell an interactive story or allow users to play a game.

- Your product should be reasonably original with regards to apps that are available on the web these days.

- Your product should embody good interaction design practices.

- Your product's design should fit well in the platform you're using for layout, like Bootstrap.

> Note: originality in this case should likely come from restricting your idea to a specific target audience, to a specific data set, or in some other way. Restraint can help you make your project fit in a few weeks and at the same time allow you to make it much better and more polished!

## Implementation details<small>How it should be implemented</small>

- Your web application must utilize Flask, JavaScript, and SQL.

- Your web application must be sufficiently complex, as determined by the course's instructor.

- Your web application's source code must be managed using git and be pushed to GitHub daily.

- Your web application's source code must include your name in a comment atop every source file in the project to indicate that you wrote it (unless re-using a source file from another project).

- Your web application must be shown running on the final day of the course.

- Your web application must be reproducible on another computer by cloning the repository and following instructions in the `README`.

- jQuery may not be used except to use standard functionality from web frameworks like Bootstrap.

## Process requirements<small>What else you need to do</small>

At the start of the project, create a process book in which you keep track of your progress during the project. Note that it is not necessary to describe in detail what you have been working on every day. Just describe your most important findings and challenges during the project. At the end of the project this process book gives an insight in the progression of the project from beginning to end. 

In your process book, you simply chronicle your bigger decisions. When faced with a large decision, use your process book to document the following:

* The choice you've made
* What you expect to happen as a result of that choice
* Why you expect things to pan out that way

By doing so, you can use your process book for reflection. By documenting and priodically reviewing your decisions, you'll get a better grasp on the overall project and you might be able to identify trends or common traps you find yourself falling into.

To put it simply, a process book helps to refine your decision-making process as you move forward, rather than being something that helps you actually make a choice in the moment.
