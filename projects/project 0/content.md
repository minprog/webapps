# Project 0: Homepage

## Objectives

* Become more comfortable with HTML and CSS to design and style webpages.
* Learn to use SCSS to write more complex stylesheets for your webpages.

## Getting Started

### Your First Webpage

Open "Git Bash" on Windows or the "Terminal" on macOS.

`cd` to a directory where you want to put your project. 
    
    $ curl -O https://cdn.cs50.net/web/2018/spring/projects/0/project0.zip
    $ unzip project0.zip
    $ rm project0.zip
    $ cd project0
    
 Now, run

    touch index.html

to create a new `index.html` file in your repository. Open the file with your
favorite text editor. Then, paste in the following contents:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>My Webpage</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            Hello, world!
        </body>
    </html>

Then, save your `index.html` file.

## Requirements

Alright, now it's time to make your website your own. Design a personal webpage
about yourself, one of your interests, or any other topic of your choice. The
subject matter, look and feel, and design of the site are entirely up to you,
subject to the following requirements:

* Your website must contain at least four different `.html` pages, and it
  should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by
  following one or more hyperlinks.
* Your website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least
  one table, and at least one image.
* Your website must have at least one stylesheet file.
* Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at
  least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the `#id` selector
  at least once, and the `.class` selector at least once.
* Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive `@media` query,
  such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.
* You must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, taking advantage of at least one
  Bootstrap [component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/),
  and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using
  Bootstrap's [grid model](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/grid/).
* Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of
  SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
* In `README.md`, include a short writeup describing your project, what's
  contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the
  staff should know about your project.

Note that not all of the above requirements are covered in [Lecture 0](/lectures/lecture%200), some will
be introduced in [Lecture 1](/lectures/lecture%201).
